TROUBLESHOOTING
1) turning on and off started working after I cleared browser history. It turns off now.
2) "Forbidden: root!" happened when I said /Users/evan/Dropbox/elephant


U.R.I. SYNTAX 
Both of these are equivalent:
file://localhost/etc/fstab
file:///etc/fstab

WINDOWS FILE PATH:
To access a file "the file.txt", the following might be used.
For a network location:
file://hostname/path/to/the%20file.txt
Or for a local file, the hostname is omitted, but the slash is not (note the third slash):
file:///c:/path/to/the%20file.txt



SET THE PATH SO APACHE CAN FIND YOUR FOLDERS:
1)  Go back to Terminal and enter sudo nano /etc/apache2/httpd.conf
2) Replace both occurrences of /Library/WebServer/Documents with /Users/david/Sites (instead of david use your name which can be found at the top of your terminal next to the home icon) 
3) Type sudo apachectl restart and press enter
Undid
/Library/WebServer/Documents

APACHE 
Apache 2.4 comes pre-packaged in macOS 10.12 Sierra, 
*check the version to verify*
httpd -v
__start the server by running the command__
apachectl start
-------------------- 
PATH OF APACHE
1) set how:
The DocumentRoot directive is set in your main server configuration file (httpd.conf) 
2) if DocumentRoot were set to /var/www/html then a request for http://www.example.com/fish/guppies.html would result in the file /var/www/html/fish/guppies.html being served to the requesting client.
------------
MAKE THE APACHE CONFIG file APPEAR! 
*from websitebeaver.com*
sudo nano /etc/apache2/httpd.conf 
Delete the #
 from #LoadModule php7_module libexec/apache2/libphp7.
-----------
PATHS WITH A SLASH AT BEGINNING
*from /etc/apache2/httpd.conf*
If the filenames do *not* begin
# with "/", the value of ServerRoot is prepended -- so "logs/access_log"
# with ServerRoot set to "/usr/local/apache2" will be interpreted by the
# server as "/usr/local/apache2/logs/access_log", whereas "/logs/access_log$
# will be interpreted as '/logs/access_log'.

note, su and sudo might need to be changed per Debian vs other Linux.
FIRST, CHECK FOR ALL USERS:
sudo less /etc/passwd
MAKE CELERY
useradd celery
(although sometimes it is "adduser")
passwd _-_-_
mkdir /home/jsmith
chown jsmith:users /home/jsmith

SWITCH USER TO CELERY
exit (neccessary if you are logged in as root)
exit
su celery
ssh celery@localhost

REGEX EXAMPLES

google or bing IP ADDRESS.  gives just machine you are on
IPCONFIG gives info too
