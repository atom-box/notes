<15: NPM>
Old Evan way:  google the address of bootstrap, paste it in, repeat
Newer NPM way: set up a list of what packages you need.  And now comes A-PACKAGE-MANAGER, a robot that hears your shopping list ('some kinda Bootstrap, some kinda normalize.css') and manages what to plug in there.  It gets server stuff too.

The NPM grocery list for modules is JSON, not lock.

"1.3.7" versus "^1.3.7" in your npmmodule PACKAGE
Load this exact one.     Load this or newer one.

The Udemy course gives you a pre-written package.json.   You therefore get all the same versions as him.
