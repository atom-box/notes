# Flexbox
## General
1) Tag your item.  In below example we made it id tag.    ID #  could make it class  .
2) css is always no quotes, 
3) word colon word semicolon,   
4) single-words-so-should-dash-connect
5) got lots of mileage in flexbox froggy using ALIGN-CONTENT, ALIGN-ITEMS

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::
EXAMPLE;
#pond {
  display: flex;
  align-content GOES LEFT-RIGHT
}

#kneepain
I'm learning to affect pain by stretching.  
The six traditional runner's stretches are all reducers of pain. 
If you sit in a weird way in a chair, the stretch that it applies sometimes loosens the wrong thing and is an increaser of pain when walking later.

Do you have other fun things to do when taking a break?
I have a note on the keybard that says: 'Do flexbox froggy, not surfing/posting on breaks." Thumbs up, @playcodepip
