#Elm

## Elm, from Wikipedia
Elm is a domain-specific programming language for declaratively creating web browser-based graphical user interfaces. Elm is purely functional, and is developed with emphasis on usability, performance, and robustness. It advertises "no runtime exceptions in practice,"[4] made possible by the Elm compiler's static type checking.

Story putting up a tent.  I can pretty much do it.  Errors are: lose a peg.  But it stands, and is reasonable.
Plumbing.  And turning the onn switch.

##functional programming
In computer science, functional programming is a programming paradigm—a style of building the structure and elements of computer programs—that treats computation as the evaluation of mathematical functions and avoids changing-state and mutable data. It is a declarative programming paradigm, which means programming is done with expressions or declarations[1] instead of statements.
