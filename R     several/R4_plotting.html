<h2>Basic Plots</h2>

<p>
We look at some of the ways R can display information
graphically. This is a basic introduction to some of the basic
plotting commands. It is assumed that you know how to enter data or
read data files which is covered in the <a href="http://www.cyclismo.org/tutorial/R/input.html">first
chapter</a>, and it is assumed that you are familiar with the
different <a href="http://www.cyclismo.org/tutorial/R/types.html">data types</a>.
</p>

<p>
In each of the topics that follow it is assumed that two different
data sets, <a href="http://www.cyclismo.org/tutorial/R/w1.dat">w1.dat</a> and <a href="http://www.cyclismo.org/tutorial/R/trees91.csv">trees91.csv</a> have been read and defined using
the same variables as in the <a href="http://www.cyclismo.org/tutorial/R/input.html">first
chapter</a>. Both of these data sets come from the study discussed on
the web site given in the <a href="http://www.cyclismo.org/tutorial/R/input.html">first chapter</a>. We
assume that they are read using "read.csv" into variables "w1" and
"tree:"
</p>

<pre>&gt;  w1 &lt;- read.csv(file="w1.dat",sep=",",head=TRUE)
&gt; names(w1)
[1] "vals"
&gt;  tree &lt;- read.csv(file="trees91.csv",sep=",",head=TRUE)
&gt; names(tree)
 [1] "C"      "N"      "CHBR"   "REP"    "LFBM"   "STBM"   "RTBM"   "LFNCC" 
 [9] "STNCC"  "RTNCC"  "LFBCC"  "STBCC"  "RTBCC"  "LFCACC" "STCACC" "RTCACC"
[17] "LFKCC"  "STKCC"  "RTKCC"  "LFMGCC" "STMGCC" "RTMGCC" "LFPCC"  "STPCC" 
[25] "RTPCC"  "LFSCC"  "STSCC"  "RTSCC"

<h3><a name="strip">Strip Charts</a></h3>

<p>
A strip chart is the most basic type of plot available. It plots the
data in order along a line with each data point represented as a
box. Here we provide examples using the "w1" data frame mentioned at
the top of this page, and the one column of the data is "w1$vals."
</p>

<p>
To create a strip chart of this data use the <span class="command">stripchart</span> command:
</p>

<pre>stripchart(w1$vals)
</pre>

<p>
As you can see this is about as bare bones as you can get. There is no
title nor axes labels. It only shows how the data looks if you were to
put it all along one line and mark out a box at each point. If you
would prefer to see which points are repeated you can specify that
repeated points be stacked: 
</p>

<pre>&gt; stripchart(w1$vals,method="stack")
</pre>

<p>
A variation on this is to have the boxes moved up and down so that
there is more separation between them:
</p>

<pre>&gt; stripchart(w1$vals,method="jitter")
</pre>

<p>
If you do not want the boxes plotting in the horizontal direction you
can plot them in the vertical direction:
</p>

<pre>&gt; stripchart(w1$vals,vertical=TRUE)
&gt; stripchart(w1$vals,vertical=TRUE,method="jitter")
</pre>

<p>
Since you should <b>always annotate</b> your plots there are many
different ways to add titles and labels. One way is within the
stripchart command itself:
</p>

<pre>&gt; stripchart(w1$vals,method="stack",
       main='Leaf BioMass in High CO2 Environment',
       xlab='BioMass of Leaves')
</pre>

<p>
If you have a plot already and want to add a title, you can use the
<span class="command">title</span> command:
</p>

<pre>&gt; title('Leaf BioMass in High CO2 Environment',xlab='BioMass of Leaves')
</pre>

<p>
Note that this simply adds the title and labels and will write over
the top of any titles or labels you already have.
</p>

<h3><a name="histograms">Histograms</a></h3>

<p>
A histogram is very common plot. It plots the frequencies that data
appears within certain ranges. Here we provide examples using the "w1"
data frame mentioned at the top of this page, and the one column of
data is "w1$vals."
</p>


<p>
To plot a histogram of the data use the "hist" command:
</p>

<pre>&gt; hist(w1$vals)
</pre>

<p>
As you can see R will automatically calculate the intervals to
use. There are <b>many</b> options to determine how to break up the
intervals. Here we look at just one way, varying the domain size and
number of breaks. If you would like to know more about the other
options check out the help page:
</p>

<pre>&gt; help(hist)
</pre>

<p>
You can specify the number of breaks to use using the <span class="command">breaks</span> option. Here we look at the histogram
for various numbers of breaks:
</p>

<pre>&gt; hist(w1$vals,breaks=2)
&gt; hist(w1$vals,breaks=4)
&gt; hist(w1$vals,breaks=6)
&gt; hist(w1$vals,breaks=8)
&gt; hist(w1$vals,breaks=12)
&gt;
</pre>

<p>
You can also vary the size of the domain using the <span class="command">xlim</span> option. This option takes a vector with
two entries in it, the left value and the right value:
</p>

<pre>&gt; hist(w1$vals,breaks=12,xlim=c(0,10))
&gt; hist(w1$vals,breaks=12,xlim=c(-1,2))
&gt; hist(w1$vals,breaks=12,xlim=c(0,2))
&gt; hist(w1$vals,breaks=12,xlim=c(1,1.3))
&gt; hist(w1$vals,breaks=12,xlim=c(0.9,1.3))
&gt; 
</pre>

<p>
The options for adding titles and labels are exactly the same as for
strip charts.  You should <b>always annotate</b> your plots and there
are many different ways to add titles and labels. One way is within
the <span class="command">hist</span> command itself:
</p>

<pre>&gt; hist(w1$vals,
       main='Leaf BioMass in High CO2 Environment',
       xlab='BioMass of Leaves')
</pre>


<p>
If you have a plot already and want to change or add a title, you can
use the <span class="command">title</span> command:
</p>

<pre>&gt; title('Leaf BioMass in High CO2 Environment',xlab='BioMass of Leaves')
</pre>

<p>
Note that this simply adds the title and labels and will write over
the top of any titles or labels you already have.
</p>

<p>
It is not uncommon to add other kinds of plots to a histogram. For
example, one of the options to the <span class="command">stripchart</span> command is to add it to a plot that
has already been drawn. For example, you might want to have a
histogram with the strip chart drawn across the top. The addition of
the strip chart might give you a better idea of the density of the
data:
</p>

<pre>&gt; hist(w1$vals,main='Leaf BioMass in High CO2 Environment',xlab='BioMass of Leaves',ylim=c(0,16))
&gt; stripchart(w1$vals,add=TRUE,at=15.5)
</pre>


<h3><a name="boxplots">Boxplots</a></h3>

<p>
A boxplot provides a graphical view of the median, quartiles, maximum,
and minimum of a data set.  Here we provide examples using two
different data sets.  The first is the "w1" data frame mentioned at
the top of this page, and the one column of data is "w1$vals." The
second is the "tree" data frame from the "trees91.csv" data file which
is also mentioned at the top of the page.
</p>

<p>
We first use the "w1" data set and look at the boxplot of this data set:
</p>

<pre>&gt; boxplot(w1)
</pre>

<p>
Again, this is a very plain graph, and the title and labels can be
specified in exactly the same way as in the <span class="command">stripchart</span> and <span class="command">hist</span> commands:
</p>

<pre>&gt; boxplot(w1$vals,
          main='Leaf BioMass in High CO2 Environment',
	  ylab='BioMass of Leaves')
</pre>

<p>
Note that the default orientation is to plot the boxplot
vertically. Because of this we used the <span class="command">ylab</span> option to specify the axis label. There
are a large number of options for this command. To see more of the
options see the help page:
</p>

<pre>&gt; help(boxplot)
</pre>

<p>
As an example you can specify that the boxplot be plotted horizontally
by specifying the <span class="command">horizontal</span> option:
</p>

<pre>&gt; boxplot(w1$vals,
          main='Leaf BioMass in High CO2 Environment',
          xlab='BioMass of Leaves',
	  horizontal=TRUE)
</pre>

<p>
The option to plot the box plot horizontally can be put to good use to
display a box plot on the same image as a histogram. You need to
specify the <span class="command">add</span> option, specify where to
put the box plot using the <span class="command">at</span> option, and
turn off the addition of axes using the <span class="command">axes</span> option:
</p>

<pre>&gt; hist(w1$vals,main='Leaf BioMass in High CO2 Environment',xlab='BioMass of Leaves',ylim=c(0,16))
&gt; boxplot(w1$vals,horizontal=TRUE,at=15.5,add=TRUE,axes=FALSE)
</pre>

<p>
If you are feeling really crazy you can take a histogram and add a
box plot and a strip chart:
</p>


<pre>&gt; hist(w1$vals,main='Leaf BioMass in High CO2 Environment',xlab='BioMass of Leaves',ylim=c(0,16))
&gt; boxplot(w1$vals,horizontal=TRUE,at=16,add=TRUE,axes=FALSE)
&gt; stripchart(w1$vals,add=TRUE,at=15)
</pre>

<p>
Some people shell out good money to have this much fun.
</p>


<p>
For the second part on boxplots we will look at the second data frame,
"tree," which comes from the "trees91.csv" file. To reiterate the
discussion at the top of this page and the discussion in the <a href="http://www.cyclismo.org/tutorial/R/types.html">data types</a> chapter, we need to specify which
columns are factors:
</p>

<pre>&gt; tree &lt;- read.csv(file="trees91.csv",sep=",",head=TRUE)
&gt; tree$C &lt;- factor(tree$C)
&gt; tree$N &lt;- factor(tree$N)
</pre>

<p>
We can look at the boxplot of just the data for the stem biomass:
</p>

<pre>&gt; boxplot(tree$STBM,
          main='Stem BioMass in Different CO2 Environments',
	  ylab='BioMass of Stems')
</pre>

<p>
That plot does not tell the whole story. It is for all of the trees,
but the trees were grown in different kinds of environments. The <span class="command">boxplot</span> command can be used to plot a separate
box plot for each level. In this case the data is held in "tree$STBM,"
and the different levels are stored as factors in "tree$C." The
command to create different boxplots is the following:
</p>

<pre>boxplot(tree$STBM~tree$C)
</pre>

<p>
Note that for the level called "2" there are four outliers which are
plotted as little circles. There are many options to annotate your
plot including different labels for each level. Please use the <span class="command">help(boxplot)</span> command for more information.
</p>

<h3><a name="scatter">Scatter Plots</a></h3>

<p>
A scatter plot provides a graphical view of the relationship between
two sets of numbers.  Here we provide examples using the "tree" data
frame from the "trees91.csv" data file which is mentioned at the top
of the page. In particular we look at the relationship between the
stem biomass ("tree$STBM") and the leaf biomass ("tree$LFBM").
</p>

<p>
The command to plot each pair of points as an <em>x</em>-coordinate
and a <em>y</em>-coorindate is "plot:" 
</p>

<pre>&gt; plot(tree$STBM,tree$LFBM)
</pre>

<p>
It appears that there is a strong positive association between the
biomass in the stems of a tree and the leaves of the tree. It
<b>appears</b> to be a linear relationship. In fact, the corelation
between these two sets of observations is quite high:
</p>

<pre>&gt; cor(tree$STBM,tree$LFBM)
[1] 0.911595
&gt; 
</pre>

<p>
Getting back to the plot, you should always annotate your graphs. The
title and labels can be specified in exactly the same way as with the
other plotting commands:
</p>

<pre>&gt; plot(tree$STBM,tree$LFBM,
       main="Relationship Between Stem and Leaf Biomass",
       xlab="Stem Biomass",
       ylab="Leaf Biomass")
</pre>

<h3><a name="qqplot">Normal QQ Plots</a></h3>

<p>
The final type of plot that we look at is the normal quantile
plot. This plot is used to determine if your data is close to being
normally distributed. You cannot be sure that the data is normally
distributed, but you can rule out if it is not normally distributed.
Here we provide examples using the "w1" data frame mentioned at the
top of this page, and the one column of data is "w1$vals."
</p>

<p>
The command to generate a normal quantile plot is <span class="command">qqnorm</span>. You can give it one argument, the
univariate data set of interest:
</p>

<pre>&gt; qqnorm(w1$vals)
</pre>

<p>
You can annotate the plot in exactly the same way as all of the other
plotting commands given here:
</p>

<pre>&gt; qqnorm(w1$vals,
         main="Normal Q-Q Plot of the Leaf Biomass",
	 xlab="Theoretical Quantiles of the Leaf Biomass",
	 ylab="Sample Quantiles of the Leaf Biomass")
</pre>

<p>
After you creat the normal quantile plot you can also add the
theoretical line that the data should fall on if they were normally
distributed:
</p>

<pre>&gt; qqline(w1$vals)
</pre>

<p>
In this example you should see that the data is not quite normally
distributed. There are a few outliers, and it does not match up at the
tails of the distribution.
