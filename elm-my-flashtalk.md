##Elm, from Wikipedia
Elm is a domain-specific programming language for declaratively creating web browser-based graphical user interfaces. Elm is purely functional, and is developed with emphasis on usability, performance, and robustness. It advertises "no runtime exceptions in practice,"[4] made possible by the Elm compiler's static type checking. 
`Typing discipline:`	Static, Strong, Inferred
`Influenced by: ` Haskell, F# 

##Categories for Elm:
Elm is strongly typed (Like Java, not C)
Elm enforces types on Javascript (like TypeScript and GraphQL)
Elm is functional (like Haskell)
Elm lacks semi-colons and curly braces (like Python)
Elm is compiled.  

##functional programming
In computer science, functional programming is a programming paradigm—a style of building the structure and elements of computer programs—that treats computation as the evaluation of mathematical functions and avoids changing-state and mutable data. It is a declarative programming paradigm, which means programming is done with expressions or declarations instead of statements.

	#Steve Martin notes
	Obsession is a substitute for talent. 
	Be willing to eliminate everything that is not original from your 'act'.
	Enjoyment while performing was RARE.   Long hours in elation or dejection.
	
	Years:
	10 + 4 + 4 
	Learning + Refining + Wild-success
	
	The course (to success) was more plodding than heroic, with a few intuitive leaps.
	
	And now the napkin trick.
