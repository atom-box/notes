## MODULES SOLVED!  Two hours at Starbucks:
import {dummy} from './bottom.js';
// to avoid CORS error, get path right
// THE file that is the head can be anywhere, but the next called path must have same insert point on the tree.

## Ways to modify the document 
### MAGICAL WAY TO DIVULGE OBJECT STATUS -- READ INSIDE JONAH
const http = require('http');
const PORT = 4923;

var jonah =(take, give)=>{
  const seconds = (new Date()).getSeconds();
  const time = new Date();
  for(let key in take){
    console.log(key);
    console.log(take[key]);
    console.log(':::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::');
  }
  give.end(`The time is ${time} and you gave me `);
}

const whale = http.createServer(jonah);
const confirm = console.log(`Everything is alright on port ${PORT}.`);
whale.listen(PORT, confirm);

### ONCLICK -> GETBYID/TEXTCONTENT
<script type="text/javascript">
function alert(){
  document.getElementById('divA').textContent = 'This text is different!';
}
</script>
      <button onclick="alert()">press</button>
      <div id="divA"></div>

## For loops in 1996, ES5, and ES6
1. For(i in things)    THIS GIVES THE INDEXES...AS STRINGS!
2. things.foreach
`
myArray.forEach(function (value) {
  console.log(value);
});
`
3. PROBABLY THE BEST, IN MOST CASES
for(n of things)
BEST BECAUSE has 	break, continue, return.

## MultiLine Strings
Fave hack
var multiStr = [
  "This is the first line",
  "This is the second line",
  "This is more..."
].join("\n");

Google javascript styleguide
var multiStr = "This is the first line" + 
	"This is the second line" + 
	"This is more...";

## 4: ZAKAS, Understanding Objects
You access object properties either with dot notation or with a STRING in brackets.
By default, a property is enumerable; this can be turned off however.
IFF enumerable, the property will appear in Object.keys();
Check for property by IN.  As in "first IN person";
Inheritance causes some properties to be OWN PROPERTY.  Others are PROPERTIES INHERITED FROM THE PROTOTYPE.
The word IN finds those two things indistinguishable.
person1.hasOwnProperty("height") is the more-discriminating alternative to IN.

This book is for two, maybe three categories of programmers.  If you are have finished a JS course or two, this book will fill in the stuff they couldn't properly teach you on the first run through the language.  If you know Python, C++, or Java, and are an immigrant to JS, this book will answer 100s of questions you have, and hopefully, ease your justified cynicism about JS.  
If you have several years of JS programming under your belt, this may help you organize the things you have learned along the way so that you can talk in groups more clearly.

It is less than 100 pages but they are concise!  Unless you are a pro, it will take you a long time to read these 100 pages, guaranteed.  It is pleasant reading.  The examples are clear.  More importantly, the chapter-end summaries are clear.  The title is accurate.
