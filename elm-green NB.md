# Green Notes: Elm

## Speak correctly: Update Fn
How to say the colon line out loud,
"Elm-function-called-blank will do the following with types" MESSAGE, take the MODEL, return a MODEL"
-----where message is a container of all verbs--
^update : Msg -> Model -> Model


## Speak Correctly: Main  
We are 
PASSING “Helloworld” string as a 
parameter to the function "text".  
It gets 
EVALUATED and then
ASSIGN IT to the main function.

## Declaring
It's not strictly required. Elm DOES infer a bit.
BEST PRACTICE 
says lay out the types wireframe above the function!


Scala
Clojure
Typescript
Dart
...also compile to JS from types.
