APACHE 
Apache 2.4 comes pre-packaged in macOS 10.12 Sierra, 
*check the version to verify*
httpd -v
__start the server by running the command__
apachectl start
-------------------- 
PATH OF APACHE
1) set how:
The DocumentRoot directive is set in your main server configuration file (httpd.conf) 
2) if DocumentRoot were set to /var/www/html then a request for http://www.example.com/fish/guppies.html would result in the file /var/www/html/fish/guppies.html being served to the requesting client.
------------
MAKE THE APACHE CONFIG file APPEAR! 
*from websitebeaver.com*
sudo nano /etc/apache2/httpd.conf 
Delete the #
 from #LoadModule php7_module libexec/apache2/libphp7.
-----------
PATHS WITH A SLASH AT BEGINNING
*from /etc/apache2/httpd.conf*
If the filenames do *not* begin
# with "/", the value of ServerRoot is prepended -- so "logs/access_log"
# with ServerRoot set to "/usr/local/apache2" will be interpreted by the
# server as "/usr/local/apache2/logs/access_log", whereas "/logs/access_log$
# will be interpreted as '/logs/access_log'.
