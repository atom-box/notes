#Elm

## Elm, from Wikipedia
Elm is a domain-specific programming language for declaratively creating web browser-based graphical user interfaces. Elm is purely functional, and is developed with emphasis on usability, performance, and robustness. It advertises "no runtime exceptions in practice,"[4] made possible by the Elm compiler's static type checking.

Building with the light on : Building in the dark. 
Story putting up a tent.  I can pretty much do it.  Errors are: lose a peg.  But it stands, and is reasonable.
Plumbing.  And turning the onn switch.

##functional programming
In computer science, functional programming is a programming paradigm—a style of building the structure and elements of computer programs—that treats computation as the evaluation of mathematical functions and avoids changing-state and mutable data. It is a declarative programming paradigm, which means programming is done with expressions or declarations[1] instead of statements.

	#Steve Martin notes
	Obsession is a substitute for talent. 
	Be willing to eliminate everything that is not original from your 'act'.
	Enjoyment while performing was RARE.   Long hours in elation or dejection.
	
	Years:
	10 + 4 + 4 
	Learning + Refining + Wild-success
	
	The course was more plodding than heroic, with a few intuitive leaps.
	
	And now the napkin trick.
