<h2>Input</h2>

<p>
Here we explore how to define a data set in an R session. Only
two commands are explored. The first is for simple assignment of data,
and the second is for reading in a data file. There are many ways to
read data into an R session, but we focus on just two to keep it
simple.

<h3><a name="assignment">Assignment</a></h3>

<p>
The most straight forward way to store a list of numbers is through an
assignment using the <span class="command">c</span> command. (<span class="command">c</span> stands for "combine.") The idea is that a
list of numbers is stored under a given name, and the name is used to
refer to the data. A list is specified with the <span class="command">c</span> command, and assignment is specified with the
"&lt;-" symbols. Another term used to describe the list of numbers is
to call it a "vector."
</p>

<p>
The numbers within the <span class="command">c</span> command are
separated by commas. As an example, we can create a new variable,
called "bubba" which will contain the numbers 3, 5, 7, and 9:
</p>

<pre> 
&gt; bubba &lt;- c(3,5,7,9) 
&gt;
</pre>

<p>
When you enter this command you should not see any output except a new
command line. The command creates a list of numbers called "bubba." To
see what numbers is included in bubba type "bubba" and press the enter key:
</p>

<pre>&gt; bubba
[1] 3 5 7 9
&gt; 
</pre>

<p>
If you wish to work with one of the numbers you can get access to it
using the variable and then square brackets indicating which number:
</p>

<pre>&gt; bubba[2]
[1] 5
&gt; bubba[1]
[1] 3
&gt; bubba[0]
numeric(0)
&gt; bubba[3]
[1] 7
&gt; bubba[4]
[1] 9
&gt; 
</pre>

<p>
Notice that the first entry is referred to as the number 1 entry, and
the zero entry can be used to indicate how the computer will treat the
data. You can store strings using both single and double quotes, and
you can store real numbers.
</p>

<p>
You now have a list of numbers and are ready to explore. In the
chapters that follow we will examine the basic operations in R that
will allow you to do some of the analyses required in class.
</p>


<h3><a name="read">Reading a CSV file</a></h3>

<p>
Unfortunately, it is rare to have just a few data points that you do
not mind typing in at the prompt. It is much more common to have a lot
of data points with complicated relationships. Here we will examine
how to read a data set from a file using the <span class="command">read.csv</span> function but first discuss the format
of a data file.
</p>

<p>
We assume that the data file is in the format called "comma separated
values" (csv).  That is, each line contains a row of values which can
be numbers or letters, and each value is separated by a comma. We also
assume that the very first row contains a list of labels. The idea is
that the labels in the top row are used to refer to the different
columns of values.
</p>

<p>
First we read a very short, somewhat silly, data file. The data file
is called <a href="http://www.cyclismo.org/tutorial/R/simple.csv">simple.csv</a> and has three columns of
data and six rows. The three columns are labeled "trial," "mass," and
"velocity." We can pretend that each row comes from an observation
during one of two trials labeled "A" and "B." A copy of the data file
is shown below and is created in defiance of Werner Heisenberg:
</p>

<pre>"trial","mass","velocity"
"A",10,12
"A",11,14
"B",5,8
"B",6,10
"A",10.5,13
"B",7,11
</pre>

<p>
The command to read the data file is <span class="command">read.csv</span>.  We have to give the command at least
one arguments, but we will give three different arguments to indicate
how the command can be used in different situations. The first
argument is the name of file. The second argument indicates whether or
not the first row is a set of labels. The third argument indicates
that there is a comma between each number of each line. The following
command will read in the data and assign it to a variable called
"heisenberg:"
</p>

<pre>&gt; heisenberg &lt;- read.csv(file="simple.csv",head=TRUE,sep=",")
&gt; heisenberg
  trial mass velocity
1     A 10.0       12
2     A 11.0       14
3     B  5.0        8
4     B  6.0       10
5     A 10.5       13
6     B  7.0       11
&gt; summary(heisenberg)
 trial      mass          velocity    
 A:3   Min.   : 5.00   Min.   : 8.00  
 B:3   1st Bu.: 6.25   1st Qu.:10.25  
       Median : 8.50   Median :11.50  
       Mean   : 8.25   Mean   :11.33  
       3rd Qu.:10.38   3rd Qu.:12.75  
       Max.   :11.00   Max.   :14.00  
&gt; 
</pre>

<p>
(Note that if you are using a Microsoft system the file naming 
convention is different from what we use here. If you want to
use a backslash it needs to be escaped, i.e. use two backslashes 
together "\\." Also you can specify what folder to use by clicking 
on the "File" option in the main menu and choose the option to
specify your working directory.)
</p>

<p>
The variable "heisenberg" contains the three columns of data. Each
column is assigned a name based on the header (the first line in the
file). You can now access each individual column using a "$" to
separate the two names:
</p>

<pre>&gt; heisenberg$trial
[1] A A B B A B
Levels: A B
&gt; heisenberg$mass 
[1] 10.0 11.0  5.0  6.0 10.5  7.0
&gt; heisenberg$velocity
[1] 12 14  8 10 13 11
&gt; 
</pre>

<p>
If you are not sure what columns are contained in the variable you can
use the <span class="command">names</span> command:
</p>

<pre>&gt; names(heisenberg)
[1] "trial"    "mass"     "velocity"
</pre>


<p>
We will look at another example which is used throughout this
tutorial. we will look at the data found in a spreadsheet located at
<a href="http://cdiac.ornl.gov/ftp/ndp061a/trees91.wk1">http://cdiac.ornl.gov/ftp/ndp061a/trees91.wk1</a>.
A description of the data file is located at <a href="http://cdiac.ornl.gov/ftp/ndp061a/ndp061a.txt">http://cdiac.ornl.gov/ftp/ndp061a/ndp061a.txt</a>.
The original data is given in an excel spreadsheet. It has been
converted into a csv file, <a href="http://www.cyclismo.org/tutorial/R/trees91.csv">trees91.csv</a>, by
deleting the top set of rows and saving it as a "csv" file. This is an
option to save within excel. (You should save <a href="http://www.cyclismo.org/tutorial/R/trees91.csv">the file</a> on your computer.) It is a good idea
to open this file in a spreadsheet and look at it. This will help you
make sense of how R stores the data.
</p>

<p>
The data is used to indicate an estimate of biomass of ponderosa pine
in a study performed by Dale W. Johnson, J. Timothy Ball, and Roger
F. Walker who are associated with the Biological Sciences Center,
Desert Research Institute, P.O. Box 60220, Reno, NV 89506 and the
Environmental and Resource Sciences College of Agriculture, University
of Nevada, Reno, NV 89512. The data is consists of 54 lines, and each
line represents an observation. Each observation includes measurements
and markers for 28 different measurements of a given tree. For
example, the first number in each row is a number, either 1, 2, 3, or
4, which signifies a different level of exposure to carbon
dioxide. The sixth number in every row is an estimate of the biomass
of the stems of a tree. Note that the very first line in the file is a
list of labels used for the different columns of data.
</p>

<p>
The data can be read into a variable called "tree" in using the <span class="command">read.csv</span> command:
</p>

<pre>&gt; tree &lt;- read.csv(file="trees91.csv",header=TRUE,sep=",");
</pre>

<p>
This will create a new variable called "tree." If you type in "tree"
at the prompt and hit enter, all of the numbers stored in the variable
will be printed out. Try this, and you should see that it is difficult
to make any sense out of the numbers.
</p>

<p>
There are many different ways to keep track of data in R. When you use
the <span class="command">read.csv</span> command R uses a specific
kind of variable called a "data frame." All of the data are stored
within the data frame as separate columns. If you are not sure what
kind of variable you have then you can use the <span class="command">attributes</span> command. This will list all of the
things that R uses to describe the variable:
</p>

<pre>&gt; attributes(tree)
$names
 [1] "C"      "N"      "CHBR"   "REP"    "LFBM"   "STBM"   "RTBM"   "LFNCC" 
 [9] "STNCC"  "RTNCC"  "LFBCC"  "STBCC"  "RTBCC"  "LFCACC" "STCACC" "RTCACC"
[17] "LFKCC"  "STKCC"  "RTKCC"  "LFMGCC" "STMGCC" "RTMGCC" "LFPCC"  "STPCC" 
[25] "RTPCC"  "LFSCC"  "STSCC"  "RTSCC" 

$class
[1] "data.frame"

$row.names
 [1] "1"  "2"  "3"  "4"  "5"  "6"  "7"  "8"  "9"  "10" "11" "12" "13" "14" "15"
[16] "16" "17" "18" "19" "20" "21" "22" "23" "24" "25" "26" "27" "28" "29" "30"
[31] "31" "32" "33" "34" "35" "36" "37" "38" "39" "40" "41" "42" "43" "44" "45"
[46] "46" "47" "48" "49" "50" "51" "52" "53" "54"

&gt; 
</pre>

<p>
The first thing that R stores is a list of names which refer to each
column of the data. For example, the first column is called "C", the
second column is called "N." Tree is of type data.frame. Finally, the
rows are numbered consecutively from 1 to 54. Each column has 54
numbers in it.
</p>

<p>
If you know that a variable is a data frame but are not sure what
labels are used to refer to the different columns you can use the
<span class="command">names</span> command:
</p>

<pre>&gt; names(tree)
 [1] "C"      "N"      "CHBR"   "REP"    "LFBM"   "STBM"   "RTBM"   "LFNCC" 
 [9] "STNCC"  "RTNCC"  "LFBCC"  "STBCC"  "RTBCC"  "LFCACC" "STCACC" "RTCACC"
[17] "LFKCC"  "STKCC"  "RTKCC"  "LFMGCC" "STMGCC" "RTMGCC" "LFPCC"  "STPCC" 
[25] "RTPCC"  "LFSCC"  "STSCC"  "RTSCC" 
&gt; 
</pre>

<p>
If you want to work with the data in one of the columns you give the
name of the data frame, a "$" sign, and the label assigned to the
column. For example, the first column in <em>tree</em> can be called
using "tree$C:"
</p>

<pre>&gt; tree$C
 [1] 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 3 3 3 3 3 3 3
[39] 3 3 3 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4
&gt; 
</pre>


<h3><a name="fwf">Brief Note on Fixed Width Files</a></h3>

<p>
There are many ways to read data using R. We only give two examples,
direct assignment and reading csv files. However, another way
deserves a brief mention. It is common to come across data that is
organized in flat files and delimited at preset locations on each
line. This is often called a "fixed width file."
</p>

<p>
The command to deal with these kind of files is <span class="command">read.fwf.</span> Examples of how to use this command
are not given here, but if you would like more information on how to
use this command enter the following command:
</p>

<pre>&gt; help(read.fwf)
