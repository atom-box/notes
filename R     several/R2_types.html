<h2>Basic Data Types</h2>

<p>
We look at some of the ways that R can store and organize data. This
is a basic introduction to a small subset of the different data types
recognized by R and is not comprehensive in any sense. The main goal
is to demonstrate the different kinds of information R can handle. It
is assumed that you know how to enter data or read data files which is
covered in the <a href="http://www.cyclismo.org/tutorial/R/input.html">first chapter</a>.

<h3><a name="numbers">Numbers</a></h3>

<p>
The way to work with real numbers has already been covered in the <a href="http://www.cyclismo.org/tutorial/R/input.html">first chapter</a> and is briefly discussed
here. The most basic way to store a number is to make an assignment of
a single number:
</p>

<pre>&gt; a &lt;- 3
&gt; 
</pre>

<p>
The "&lt;-" tells R to take the number to the right of the symbol and
store it in a variable whose name is given on the left. You can also
use the "=" symbol. When you make an assignment R does not print out
any information. If you want to see what value a variable has just
type the name of the variable on a line and press the enter key:
</p>

<pre>&gt; a
[1] 3
&gt; 
</pre>

<p>
This allows you to do all sorts of basic operations and save the numbers:
</p>

<pre>&gt; b &lt;- sqrt(a*a+3)
&gt; b
[1] 3.464102
&gt; 
</pre>

<p>
If you want to get a list of the variables that you have defined in a
particular session you can list them all using the <span class="command">ls</span> command:
</p>

<pre>&gt; ls()
[1] "a" "b"
&gt; 
</pre>

<p>
You are not limited to just saving a single number. You can create a
list (also called a "vector") using the <span class="command">c</span>
command:
</p>

<pre>&gt; a &lt;- c(1,2,3,4,5)
&gt; a
[1] 1 2 3 4 5
&gt; a+1
[1] 2 3 4 5 6
&gt; mean(a)
[1] 3
&gt; var(a)
[1] 2.5
&gt; 
</pre>

<p>
You can get access to particular entries in the vector in the
following manner:
</p>

<pre>&gt; a &lt;- c(1,2,3,4,5)
&gt; a[1]
[1] 1
&gt; a[2]
[1] 2
&gt; a[0]
numeric(0)
&gt; a[5]
[1] 5
&gt; a[6]
[1] NA
&gt; 
</pre>

<p>
Note that the zero entry is used to indicate how the data is
stored. The first entry in the vector is the first number, and if you
try to get a number past the last number you get "NA."
</p>

<p>
Examples of the sort of operations you can do on vectors is given in a
<a href="http://www.cyclismo.org/tutorial/R/basicOps.html">previous chapter</a>.
</p>

<h3><a name="strings">Strings</a></h3>

<p>
You are not limited to just storing numbers. You can also store
strings. A string is specified by using quotes. Both single and double
quotes will work:
</p>

<pre>&gt; a &lt;- "hello" 
&gt; a
[1] "hello"
&gt; b &lt;- c("hello","there")
&gt; b
[1] "hello" "there"
&gt; b[1]
[1] "hello"
&gt; 
</pre>

<h3><a name="factors">Factors</a></h3>

<p>
Another important way R can store data is as a <span class="command">factor</span>. Often times an experiment includes
trials for different levels of some explanatory variable. For example,
when looking at the impact of carbon dioxide on the growth rate of a
tree you might try to observe how different trees grow when exposed to
different preset concentrations of carbon dioxide. The different
levels are also called <span class="command">factors</span>.
</p>

<p>
Assuming you know how to read in a file, we will look at the data file
given in the <a href="http://www.cyclismo.org/tutorial/R/input.html">first chapter</a>. Several of the
variables in the file are factors:
</p>

<pre>&gt; summary(tree$CHBR)
 A1  A2  A3  A4  A5  A6  A7  B1  B2  B3  B4  B5  B6  B7  C1  C2  C3  C4  C5  C6 
  3   1   1   3   1   3   1   1   3   3   3   3   3   3   1   3   1   3   1   1 
 C7 CL6 CL7  D1  D2  D3  D4  D5  D6  D7 
  1   1   1   1   1   3   1   1   1   1 
&gt; 
</pre>

<p>
Because the set of options given in the data file corresponding to the
"CHBR" column are not all numbers R automatically assumes that it is a
factor. When you use summary on a factor it does not print out the
five point summary, rather it prints out the possible values and the
frequency that they occur.
</p>

<p>
In this data set several of the columns are factors, but the
researchers used numbers to indicate the different levels. For
example, the first column, labeled "C," is a factor. Each trees was
grown in an environment with one of four different possible levels of
carbon dioxide. The researchers quite sensibly labeled these four
environments as 1, 2, 3, and 4. Unfortunately, R cannot determine that
these are factors and must assume that they are regular numbers.
</p>

<p>
This is a common problem and there is a way to tell R to treat the "C"
column as a set of factors. You specify that a variable is a factor
using the <span class="command">factor</span> command. In the
following example we convert <em>tree$C</em> into a factor:
</p>

<pre>&gt; tree$C
 [1] 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 3 3 3 3 3 3 3
[39] 3 3 3 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4
&gt; summary(tree$C)
   Min. 1st Qu.  Median    Mean 3rd Qu.    Max. 
  1.000   2.000   2.000   2.519   3.000   4.000 
&gt; tree$C &lt;- factor(tree$C)
&gt; tree$C
 [1] 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 3 3 3 3 3 3 3
[39] 3 3 3 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4
Levels: 1 2 3 4
&gt; summary(tree$C)
 1  2  3  4 
 8 23 10 13 
&gt; levels(tree$C)
[1] "1" "2" "3" "4"
&gt; 
</pre>

<p>
Once a vector is converted into a set of factors then R treats it in a
different manner then when it is a set of numbers. A set of factors
have a decrete set of possible values, and it does not make sense to
try to find averages or other numerical descriptions. One thing that
is important is the number of times that each factor appears, called
their "frequencies," which is printed using the <span class="command">summary</span> command.
</p>

<h3><a name="dataFrames">Data Frames</a></h3>

<p>
Another way that information is stored is in data frames. This is a
way to take many vectors of different types and store them in the same
variable. The vectors can be of all different types. For example, a
data frame may contain many lists, and each list might be a list of
factors, strings, or numbers.
</p>

<p>
There are different ways to create and manipulate data frames. Most
are beyond the scope of this introduction. They are only mentioned
here to offer a more complete description. Please see the <a href="http://www.cyclismo.org/tutorial/R/input.html">first chapter</a> for more information on data frames.
</p>

<p>
One example of how to create a data frame is given below:
</p>

<pre>&gt; a &lt;- c(1,2,3,4)
&gt; b &lt;- c(2,4,6,8)
&gt; levels &lt;- factor(c("A","B","A","B"))
&gt; bubba &lt;- data.frame(first=a,
+                     second=b,
+                     f=levels)
&gt; bubba
  first second f
1     1      2 A
2     2      4 B
3     3      6 A
4     4      8 B
&gt; summary(bubba)
     first          second    f    
 Min.   :1.00   Min.   :2.0   A:2  
 1st Qu.:1.75   1st Qu.:3.5   B:2  
 Median :2.50   Median :5.0        
 Mean   :2.50   Mean   :5.0        
 3rd Qu.:3.25   3rd Qu.:6.5        
 Max.   :4.00   Max.   :8.0        
&gt; bubba$first
[1] 1 2 3 4
&gt; bubba$second
[1] 2 4 6 8
&gt; bubba$f     
[1] A B A B
Levels: A B
&gt; 
</pre>

<h3><a name="tables">Tables</a></h3>

<p>
Another common way to store information is in a table. Here we look at
how to define both one way and two way tables. We only look at how to
create and define tables; the functions used in the analysis of
proportions are examined in <a href="http://www.cyclismo.org/tutorial/R/tables.html">another chapter</a>.


</p><h3><a name="oneWay">One Way Tables</a></h3>

<p>
The first example is for a one way table. One way tables are not the
most interesting example, but it is a good place to start. One way to
create a table is using the <span class="command">table</span>
command. The arguments it takes is a vector of factors, and it
calculates the frequency that each factor occurs. Here is an example
of how to create a one way table:
</p>

<pre>&gt; a &lt;- factor(c("A","A","B","A","B","B","C","A","C"))
&gt; results &lt;- table(a)
&gt; results
a
A B C 
4 3 2 
&gt; attributes(results)
$dim
[1] 3

$dimnames
$dimnames$a
[1] "A" "B" "C"


$class
[1] "table"

&gt; summary(results)
Number of cases in table: 9 
Number of factors: 1 
&gt; 
</pre>

<p>
If you know the number of occurrences for each factor then it is
possible to create the table directly, but the process is,
unfortunately, a bit more convoluted. There is an easier way to define
one-way tables (a table with one row), but it does not extend easily
to two-way tables (tables with more than one row). You must first
create a matrix of numbers. A matrix is like a vector in that it is a
list of numbers, but it is different in that you can have both rows
and columns of numbers. For example, in our example above the number
of occurrences of "A" is 4, the number of occurrences of "B" is 3, and
the number of occurrences of "C" is 2. We will create one row of
numbers. The first column contains a 4, the second column contains a
3, and the third column contains a 2:
</p>

<pre>&gt; occur &lt;- matrix(c(4,3,2),ncol=3,byrow=TRUE)
&gt; occur
     [,1] [,2] [,3]
[1,]    4    3    2
</pre>

<p>
At this point the variable "occur" is a matrix with one row and three
columns of numbers. To dress it up and use it as a table we would like
to give it labels for each columns just like in the previous
example. Once that is done we convert the matrix to a table using the
<span class="command">as.table</span> command:
</p>

<pre>&gt; colnames(occur) &lt;- c("A","B","C")
&gt; occur
     A B C
[1,] 4 3 2
&gt; occur &lt;- as.table(occur)
&gt; occur
  A B C
A 4 3 2
&gt; attributes(occur)
$dim
[1] 1 3

$dimnames
$dimnames[[1]]
[1] "A"

$dimnames[[2]]
[1] "A" "B" "C"


$class
[1] "table"

&gt;
</pre>

<h3><a name="twoWay">Two Way Tables</a></h3>

<p>
If you want to add rows to your table just add another vector to the
argument of the table command. In the example below we have two
questions. In the first question the responses are labeled "Never,"
"Sometimes," or "Always." In the second question the responses are
labeled "Yes," "No," or "Maybe." The set of vectors "a," and "b,"
contain the response for each measurement. The third item in "a" is
how the third person responded to the first question, and the third
item in "b" is how the third person responded to the second question.
</p>

<pre>&gt; a &lt;- c("Sometimes","Sometimes","Never","Always","Always","Sometimes","Sometimes","Never")
&gt; b &lt;- c("Maybe","Maybe","Yes","Maybe","Maybe","No","Yes","No")
&gt; results &lt;- table(a,b)
&gt; results
           b
a           Maybe No Yes
  Always        2  0   0
  Never         0  1   1
  Sometimes     2  1   1
&gt;
</pre>

<p>
The table command allows us to do a very quick calculation, and we can
immediately see that two people who said "Maybe" to the first question
also said "Sometimes" to the second question. 
</p>

<p>
Just as in the case with one-way tables it is possible to manually
enter two way tables. The procedure is exactly the same as above
except that we now have more than one row. We give a brief example
below to demonstrate how to enter a two-way table that includes
breakdown of a group of people by both their gender and whether or not
they smoke. You enter all of the data as one long list but tell R to
break it up into some number of columns:
</p>

<pre>&gt; sexsmoke&lt;-matrix(c(70,120,65,140),ncol=2,byrow=TRUE)
&gt; rownames(sexsmoke)&lt;-c("male","female")
&gt; colnames(sexsmoke)&lt;-c("smoke","nosmoke")
&gt; sexsmoke &lt;- as.table(sexsmoke)
&gt; sexsmoke
       smoke nosmoke
male      70     120
female    65     140
&gt; 
</pre>
